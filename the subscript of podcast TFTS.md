# the subscript of podcast *TFTS*

the steps :

1. crawl the original subscript.	(crawl)
2. "clean and refresh" it.    (regular)
3. format as a LaTex file.    (LaTex template)
4. transfer to pdf file.    (call the compile command)
5. sent to me.    (email)

## Crawl the Original Subscript

> I choose the python's module "[urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide.html)" to get the webpage and "[BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc.zh/#id9)" to parser it.

the [TFTS website](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/business-podcasts/think-fast-talk-smart-podcast) stored subscripts of all episodes. And all we need to do , is let python to crap the subscript of the newest episode( or other episode is ok).
